# MoodPlaylistGenerator
An NLP-based web program that can recommend songs based on a user-given "mood"

# TODO
- Implement a way for users to find the correct song, rather than assume the first choice
- Make sure it doesn't recommend the same song twice
- Edit get_recommendations so it can take a list of songs instead of one
